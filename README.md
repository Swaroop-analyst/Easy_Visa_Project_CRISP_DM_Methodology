## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to **predict visa approval outcomes** using applicant and case attributes.  
The system helps **visa officers** and **consultants** make informed decisions by identifying key approval factors and minimizing **false positives** (wrongly approved) and **false negatives** (wrongly rejected).

The **Gradient Boosting Classifier** emerged as the top-performing model with a **high F1-score**, providing the best trade-off between precision and recall.

## üß© Dataset Summary

The EasyVisa dataset contains visa applications with fields such as:

- Applicant demographics (country, occupation, education)
- Employer information
- Job type and salary
- Application type and processing center
- Outcome (`Approved` / `Denied`)

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visuals located in `2_Data_Understanding/visuals/` illustrate:

| Visualization | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| ![Visa Status Distribution](2_Data_Understanding/visuals/visa_status_distribution.png) | Distribution of approved vs denied cases |
| ![Country Trend](2_Data_Understanding/visuals/applicant_country_trend.png) | Top applicant countries and their success rates |
| ![Correlation Heatmap](2_Data_Understanding/visuals/correlation_heatmap.png) | Relationships between numerical features |

Insights:
- Most applicants come from a few key regions.
- Visa denial rates increase for lower salary brackets.
- Education and employer sponsorship show high correlation with approval.

## üßÆ Modeling

Models trained:
- **Logistic Regression** ‚Äî baseline  
- **Random Forest (Bagging)** ‚Äî strong but overfitting observed  
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier** ‚Äî best performance overall  

**Best Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier**

üìä Key Visuals (from `4_Modeling/visuals/`):

| Visualization | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| ![Feature Importance](4_Modeling/visuals/feature_importance.png) | Top features influencing visa approval |
| ![Confusion Matrix](4_Modeling/visuals/confusion_matrix.png) | Classification performance visualization |
| ![ROC Curve](4_Modeling/visuals/roc_curve.png) | Model discrimination capability |

## üìà Results Summary

| Metric | Gradient Boosting | Random Forest | Logistic Regression |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Accuracy | High | Moderate | Baseline |
| Precision | High | Moderate | Low |
| Recall | High | Moderate | Low |
| **F1-Score** | **Highest** | Moderate | Low |

‚úÖ **Gradient Boosting achieved the highest F1-score**, effectively minimizing both **false positives** and **false negatives**.

## üí° Business Impact

- Helps visa authorities **prioritize accurate case assessments**.  
- Reduces **risk of incorrect approvals/denials**.  
- Can be deployed as a **decision-support tool** integrated into internal visa processing systems.  
- Improves **transparency** in application review.
