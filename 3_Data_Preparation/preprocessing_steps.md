# Data Preparation / Preprocessing Steps

Summary of preprocessing steps performed in the notebook (high-level):

- Handling missing values (row/column-wise strategies and imputation)
- Encoding categorical features (One-Hot / Target / Ordinal encoding where appropriate)
- Feature engineering (creating relevant buckets, interaction terms)
- Feature scaling for algorithms that require it
- Train-test split and cross-validation setup
