# Modeling Notes

Models trained and compared in the notebook:

- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (Bagging)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost / GradientBoosting)

**Best performing model:** Gradient Boosting Classifier â€” selected due to **high F1-score** and good balance between precision and recall, reducing both false positives and false negatives as per business objective.

**Notes:** Feature importance visualizations and evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, ROC curve) are included in `4_Modeling/visuals/`.
